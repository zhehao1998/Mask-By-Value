# Mask-By-Value
It is common practice in semantic/panoptic segmentation to first convert the annotated ground truth mask to a binary mask, where each pixel value corresponds to its particular class, with 0 as the background value. This is done to ensure the predicted mask of the model can be easily mapped back to the label values and overlayed onto the original image. 

This program takes in user labels and colour mapping to convert coloured ground truth masks such as those generated by CVAT and LabelMe to label value masks. Utis.py contains a showMask function which normalizes the label value mask pixels for visualization purposes.
